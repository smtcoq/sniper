(** We need to use a trick here: there
is no function in Ltac2's API which returns 
a Ltac1 value given its ident. We always need the absolute path
and we cannot look at several paths because the function [Ltac1.ref] 
throws an uncatchable exception whenever the path is not the good one.
Consequently, all the Orchestrator's tactics should be in one file, or the user has to 
provide the absolute path herself, which is not convenient at all.
Using elpi avoid these difficulties, even if the user needs
to create its own copy of all the tactic which take arguments 
TODO : a PR in Coq to avoid this problem *)
