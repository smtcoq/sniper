# Sniper

`Sniper` is a Coq plugin that provides a new Coq tactic, `snipe`, that
provides general proof automation.

This plugin can be seen as an extension of [SMTCoq](https://smtcoq.github.io), a
plugin to safely call external SMT solvers from Coq. 

`Sniper` extends
SMTCoq by translating (a subset) of Coq goals into first-order logic
before calling SMTCoq.

The translation is implemented through a combination of modular, small
transformations that independently eliminate specific aspects of Coq
logic towards first-order logic. These small transformations are safe,
generating proof terms on the fly (*certifying* transformations). 
They could have been *certified* and we plan to also write or use transformations proven once and for all in `Sniper`, as both methods are compatible with the plugin.

A
crucial transformation but external to this repository is given by the
[Trakt](https://ecrancemerce.github.io/trakt/#/) plugin.


## Installation and use

This part describes the steps required to try the `snipe` tactic.


You will need the following packages. The names are those for debian, please adapt as required for your distribution.
- opam: for installing coqide, metacoq and smtcoq
- pkg-config: required for creating an opam switch
- libgtksourceview-3.0-dev: required by coqide
- git: for installing smtcoq through opam
- bison, flex: for compiling veriT

If opam was not installed on your machine you have to initialize it (all the files are confined within ~/.opam):
```
opam init --bare --no-setup
```

It requires OCaml between 4.13.1 and 4.14:
```
opam switch create 4.13.1
eval $(opam env)
```

You need to add two opam repositories:
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
```

Then simply install this version of `Sniper`:
```
opam install coq-sniper
```

### Installation of the automatic prover and use

You also need the veriT SMT solver, using [these sources](https://www.lri.fr/~keller/Documents-recherche/Smtcoq/veriT9f48a98.tar.gz).
Once unpacked, compilation of veriT is as follows:
```
cd veriT9f48a98
./configure
make
```

We need the veriT binary to be in PATH in order for `Sniper` to use it:
```
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)"
cd ..
```

## Examples

Commented examples are available at ``examples.v``.
